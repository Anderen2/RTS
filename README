An 3D LAN-Multiplayer RTS game-engine written in Python using pyOrge for rendering and twisted for networking. 

Mainly written as a way to learn myself Python some years ago while I was still in high school.
Therefore do expect wildly varying code quality, lots of unprofessional code / comments and strange/interesting/original solutions.

I'm not actively working on this, however I may toss a commit on it now and then when I'm in the mood.
