1) Using the raycast you get the triangle you hit along with the point it hit (this will be used when offsetting the triangles texture coordinate)
2) You will want to do some sort of additional hit detection to get all the possible triangles that the decal will cover ( I used a bounding box approach )
    This will get you all the triangles the decal potentially will cover (the bounding box should be large enough to contain the decal at any rotation)
3) now that you have all of the triangles and the offset you can begin setting up the texture coordinates
4) First take the triangle that was hit by the raycast and convert it into 2d (texture coordinate)
    This is done by:
          a) Taking two sides of the triangle and getting their lengths.
          b) taking these two vectors and getting the angle between them
          c) Now you can plainly convert it into 2d (make one along the x axis (centered at 0) then rotate upwards the angle between them placing the second point)
          d) Now you want to find that offset, this is done the same method as above but instead of using 2 points above, you use the one that you place on the x axis and the collision point
          e) Focus this around the x-axis as you did with the original and now you have the point in the x,y plane where the collision point is
          f) Now you have your raycast collision triangle in 2d and the point at which the raycast hit that triangle also in 2d
          g) Use this as an offset and shift the (0,0) origin by the offset (After this you have 1 triangle created and correctly offsetted on the texture so that the texture is centered where the raycast hit)
          h) Now you essentially just have to recursively do the same for triangles connected to the centered one and connect them to the texture coord of the original
               i) This provides the problem of when converting to 2d you do not maintain the original orientation so you have to do the following:
                    1) Find the two points that the connected triangles have in common.
                    2) find the correct offset by 'attaching' one of the points of the new triangle to the one you already computed
                    3) rotate the new triangle so that the second point (that was not attached) is correctly over the already computed ones equivalent
          i) repeat 'h' until all connected triangles that were found during the bounding box detection have been created and texture coords were generated
          j) Also, you will need to offset the created decal triangles by a value of their norm (so they are not directly over the other triangle but slightly in front)
5) Done!
